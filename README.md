# ROADMAPS to fullstack web developer

### Roadmaps repository contains selected links on computer science & web development.

Website: https://rafaelaznar.github.io/roadmaps

I encourage my students:
- be authonomous to search the Internet to improve skills and programs
- develop the ability to investigate the web to learn continually by themselves
- not to read only one source
- be up to date in technology

I've been proposed to develop a book but I refused: 
- it's all in the web
- the effort to mantain books up to date is enormous
- students don't search if they have a macro-book

The roadmap is 
- continuously improved with additions and deletions
- a baseline to learn
- a collection of useful links
- where to start your readings

Also feel free to use the program under index.html 
* when I consider finished I'll create a repo called "linkenda"
* use in combination with your links colllection in README.md

Participate via pull-request.
