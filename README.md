[Roadmap repo contains selected links on computer science & web development.](content/index.md)

I encourage my students:
- be authonomous to search the Internet to improve skills and programs
- investigate the web to learn continually by themselves
- not to read only one source
- be up to date in technology

I've been proposed to develop a book but I refused: 
- it's all in the web
- the effort to mantain books up to date is enormous
- students don't search if they have a macro-book

Participate via pull-request.
