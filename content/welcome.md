# Welcome!

### This is ROADMAPS to fullstack web developer.

### ROADMAPS repository contains selected links on computer science & web development.

I encourage my students:
- be authonomous to search the Internet to improve skills and programs
- develop the ability to investigate the web to learn continually by themselves
- not to read only one source
- be up to date in technology

I've been proposed to develop a book but I refused: 
- it's all in the web
- the effort to mantain books up to date is enormous
- students don't search if they have a macro-book

The roadmap is 
- continuously improved with additions and deletions
- a baseline to learn
- one place to record when you find some baseline links to help learning
- where to start your readings

Participate via pull-request.
