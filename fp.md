Functional access to data can be used to acess to in memory big data, but they must be efficient! Funcional programming is very similar to SQL programming, both are declarative paradigms. Compilares must have a look to the database tecnology to spped access to data.](https://blog.chiselstrike.com/my-other-database-is-a-compiler-10fd527a4d78)
